            <p>Athirappalli Waterfalls, often referred to 
              as the "Niagara of India," is one of the most 
              stunning natural attractions in Kerala. Located
               in the Thrissur district, it cascades from a height 
               of approximately 80 feet, creating a spectacular sight amidst lush greenery and rocky terrains. The waterfall is formed by the Chalakudy River, which originates from the Sholayar ranges, making it a prominent tourist 
              destination and a vital ecological
               hotspot in the region.</p>
